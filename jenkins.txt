üîß Jenkins CI/CD Role in DevOps

Jenkins is used in this project as the primary Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) tool. It automates the process of building, testing, and deploying code, ensuring rapid and reliable delivery of software changes.

‚úÖ Key Responsibilities:

Continuous Integration:
Automatically triggers builds and runs tests when new code is pushed to the repository (e.g., GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket).

Automated Testing:
Executes unit, integration, or UI tests to validate code quality before deployment.

Continuous Deployment:
Deploys tested code to staging or production environments using defined pipelines (e.g., via shell scripts, Docker, Kubernetes, etc.).

Pipeline as Code:
Jenkins pipelines are defined using Jenkinsfile in the root of the repo, making the build and deployment process version-controlled and reproducible.

Notifications:
Sends alerts via email, Slack, or other integrations in case of build failures or successful deployments.

üîÅ Workflow Example

Developer pushes code to Git.

Jenkins detects the change via webhooks.

Jenkins runs tests and builds the application.

If successful, Jenkins deploys the app to the staging/production environment.

Notifications are sent to the team.
